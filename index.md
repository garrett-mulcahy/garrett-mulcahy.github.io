## About Me
<img src="picture.jpg" align="left"  width="300"> I am a third year graduate student in the Mathematics Department at the [University of Washington, Seattle](https://math.washington.edu/). I'm currently interested in entropic regularized optimal transport and its connections to machine learning. More broadly, I am interested in all things probability, optimization, and machine learning (particularly reinforcement learning and language models). 

I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Statistics at [Purdue University](https://www.math.purdue.edu/), where I had the good fortune of being mentored by Prof. Thomas Sinclair and Prof. Mark Ward. 

I have interned at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://data-science.llnl.gov/dssi) in the summers of 2021 and 2023, where I was mentored by Mikel Landajuela in projects involving reinforcement learning, language models, and symbolic regression.
In the summer of 2020, I interned at [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/) where I was mentored by Dusty Brooks and Brian Ehrhart in a project applying Bayesian statistical methods to estimate leak frequencies.

If you were expecting information about Ancient Mediterranean religions, you have the wrong Mulcahy. My sister [Ciara](https://religion.unc.edu/_people/graduate-students/) is a graduate student in religious studies at UNC Chapel Hill.

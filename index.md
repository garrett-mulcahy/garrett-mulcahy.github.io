I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the Mathematics Department at the [University of Washington, Seattle](https://math.washington.edu/), where I have the good fortune of being advised by [Prof. Soumik Pal](https://sites.math.washington.edu//~soumik/).

I plan to graduate in June 2026. **I am on the job market for postdoctoral/research positions starting Summer/Fall 2026.**

I'm currently interested in **optimal transport** and its connections to **machine learning and statistics**. 
My recent projects have involved
- approximating entropic regularized optimal transport plans (**Schrödinger bridges**) 
- approximating **gradient flows** in the Wasserstein space using Schrödinger bridges
- statistical **sensitivity analysis** via optimal transport

More broadly, I am interested in all things probability, statistics, and machine learning. I have previously worked on applied projects involving **reinforcement learning**, **language models**, and **Bayesian statistics**.

I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Statistics at [Purdue University](https://www.math.purdue.edu/), where I was generously mentored by [Prof. Thomas Sinclair](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~tsincla/).

My name is Garrett Mulcahy, and I am a senior at Purdue Univeristy studying mathematics and statistics. I have both pure and applied interests, ranging from analysis and probability to machine learning and data science. I also love to travel, and I have recently traveled to Australia, New Zealand, Italy, and India! 

If you would like to contact me, my email is garrettwmulcahy (you_know_what) gmail (etc.) com.
